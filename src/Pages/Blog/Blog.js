          1.What are the different ways to manage a state in a React
          application?
        </h3>
        <p className="py-5">
          #There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in
          your React apps:
        </p>
        <p>
          *Local (UI) state Local state is data we manage in one or another
          component.
        </p>
        <p className="py-5">
          *Global (UI) state Global state is data we manage across multiple
          components.
        </p>
        <p>
          *URL state Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and
          query parameters.
        </p>
        <p className="py-5">
          *Server state Data that comes from an external server that must be
          integrated with our UI state.

          How does prototypical inheritance work?
        </h1>
        <p>
          *The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add
          methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object
          can inherit the properties and methods of another object.
          Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object,
          we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.

          What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
        </h3>
        <p>
          *The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test
          and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an important
          step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can
          help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in
          later testing stages.
